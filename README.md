# PandaPodcasts-ChromeExtension
This repository contains the code for the following Extensions I've created:
- [Crooked Media](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/pod-save-america-crooked/goeelkadlndllemolbmfjbaeaakipoai)
- [Kerning Cultures](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/the-new-york-times-podcas/leimmikdkodgbaimglohhceidbooddma)
- [The New York Times Podcasts](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/the-new-york-times-podcas/leimmikdkodgbaimglohhceidbooddma)

### Disclosure
The Chrome Extensions are not affiliate or supported by the respective
companies. Rather, they're podcasts I'm a fan of, and I wanted a way to keep up
with them (and hopefully support them).

### About
The feature set is basic for now, and includes:
- Links to the respective social media channels
- A list of the company's podcasts
- The last 5 to 10 episodes for each podcast
- Links to view more episodes for each podcast
- An About modal, giving information and context on the Chrome Extension
- Random facts upon loading

### Screenshots
Here are some screenshots of what the UI looks like in Chrome:
